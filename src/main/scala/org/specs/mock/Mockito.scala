 *   val m = mock[java.util.List[String]] // a concrete class would be mocked with: mock(new java.util.LinkedList[String])
 *

 *   m.get(0)
 * 
 *   // verify that the call happened, this is an expectation which will throw a FailureException if that is not the case
 *   m.get(0) was called
 *   m.get(1) wasnt called // we can also check that other calls did not occur
 * }
 * </code>
