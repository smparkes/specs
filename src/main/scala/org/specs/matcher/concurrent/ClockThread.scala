/**
 * The clock thread is the manager of the MultiThreadedTest.
 * Periodically checks all the test case threads and regulates them.
 * If all the threads are blocked and at least one is waiting for a tick,
 * the clock advances to the next tick and the waiting thread is notified.
 * If none of the threads are waiting for a tick or in timed waiting,
 * a deadlock is detected. The clock thread times out if a thread is in runnable
 * or all are blocked and one is in timed waiting for longer than the runLimit.
 *
 * Algorithm in detail:
 *
 * While there are threads alive
 *
 *    If there are threads RUNNING
 *
 *       If they have been running too long
 *
 *          stop the test with a timeout error
 *
 *    else if there are threads waiting for a clock tick
 *
 *       advance the clock
 *
 *    else if there are threads in TIMED_WAITING
 *
 *       increment the deadlock counter
 *
 *       if the deadlock counter has reached a threadshold
 *
 *          stop the test due to potential deadlock
 *
 *    sleep clockPeriod ms
 *
 *
 * @param mainThread The main test thread. This thread will be waiting
 * for all the test threads to finish. It will be interrupted if the
 * ClockThread detects a deadlock or timeout.
 *
 * @param clockPeriod The period (in ms) between checks for the clock
 *
 * @param maxRunTime The limit to run the test in seconds
