/**
 * This trait defines implicit definitions which are used to create Assert objects
 * and associate them with the latest defined example<br>
 * Usage: <code>
 * 2.1 must beCloseTo(2.0, .1)
 * </code>or<br><code>
 * theDouble(2.1) must beCloseTo(2.0, .1)
 * </code><p> 
 * Most of those definitions are declared because the implicit def mechanism doesn't seem to select
 * the most specific definition (to my understanding)<br>
 * The implicit def for Strings is even stranger since values are supposed to have String as a lower bound.
 * Then StringMatchers are expecting values with String as an upper bound so that effectively only String instances
 * will be used with the implicit def (only solution found to make it all work, to my current understanding again)
